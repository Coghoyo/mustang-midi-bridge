To test, start bridge in virtual input mode and listen to MIDI channel
1 for messages:

$ mustang_midi "TestPort" 1

(Name does not matter, since it needs to be referenced by device id
assigned by Linux MIDI subsystem)

Then, find device id:

$ aconnect -o
 client 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel]
    0 'Midi Through Port-0'
 client 128: 'RtMidi Input Client' [type=user]
    0 'TestPort        '

Given the above, open RtMidi:

$ test.py "RtMidi Input Client 128:0" 1 [v1 | v2] {test name} 

(Select appropriate amp series and optionally run only a single test)
